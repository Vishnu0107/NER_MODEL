# NER_MODEL
Here I made a custom NER model for detecting specific words and numbers from a particular sentence. Here I have trained the model using the finance dataset which will extract specific terms from a sentence which include address, company , and quantity. 

## Steps to get started:

### Step 1: Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vishnu0107/NER_MODEL.git
cd NER_MODEL
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements_pip.txt
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Install CUDA and PyTorch with GPU support

Ensure you have the CUDA toolkit installed. Then, install PyTorch with GPU support.

### Step 4: Execute the Jupyter notebook

Open and execute the Jupyter notebook

```sh
jupyter notebook
```
